# The x-axis displays the fitted values
# the y-axis displays the residuals
# the residuals appear to be randomly scattered around zero 
# with no clear pattern, which indicates that the assumption
# of homoscedasticity is met.
# In other words, the coefficients of the regression model should be trustworthy and we donâ€™t need to perform a transformation on the data.


# create a quantile-quantile plot for residuals 
# to assess whether or not the residuals in a regression model
# are normally distributed
qqnorm(res)
#add a straight diagonal line to the plot
qqline(res)

# The points approximately fall on the line => the relationship between the theoretical 
# percentiles and the sample percentiles is approximately linear. 
# The normal probability plot of the residuals suggests that the error terms are normally distributed for our dataset
