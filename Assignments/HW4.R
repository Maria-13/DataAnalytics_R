####### TASK 1: 5 points. Short EDA report ###############

# The main aim of the task is to import data into R, perform brief explanatory analysis, build at least one plot,
# export data using R Markdown and 'knit' by creating an html.file

# 1. Go to https://andmed.stat.ee/en/stat and create a data set you want to explore. Import the data into R.
# 2. Prepare EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis). Write at least 5 questions and provide your answers during the first stage of EDA.
# (You can check the slides from Session 5 - Data Exploration (EDA) for ideas or come up with your own questions).
# 3. Provide brief descriptive statistical analysis of your data set (like measures of central tendency and dispersion).
# 4. Include at least one plot into your report. 
# If ggplot2 is too complicated for you now, create a plot with R base functions.
# 5. Create a pdf or html file with short EDA of your data set. Send a pdf file directly to me, send html code
# through a gist on GitHub.
