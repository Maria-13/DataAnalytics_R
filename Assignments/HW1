####### TASK 1: 0.5 points ################################

# Use R to compute the sum of the first 50 positive integers.  
# Hint: explore the sum() function


# Your output:

####### TASK 2: 1 point ################################

# 1. Create an empty vector with vector() function. 


# What is the default data type for vector?
# Your answer:

# 2. Change the data type of this empty vector to integer.


# 3. Insert different types of data (10 integers, 4 character strings, 3 logical values, e.g. TRUE, FALSE, NA)
# in the created empty vector
# Hint: think of c() function


# We tried to combine different types of data in one vector. Does R tell us it's a mistake? 
# Your answer:

# What is the class of our vector now? 
# Your answer:

# This R behaviour is called "coercion". Please describe it in your own words.
# Your answer: 


####### TASK 3: 1 point ################################

# Working with logical vectors: 
# 1. Create a vector with 10 random integers from 20 to 40, assign the name 'age' to it


# Image you want to explore the age of the participants in your vector.
# Create a logical operator for checking what entries are more or equal to 25 but less or equal to 35


# Store the results of the logical operator, assigning the name "age.range" to it


# Use the function sum() on 'age.range' to return the number of entries that are true


# How many participants are between age 25 and 35?

# Use the function which() to look at the entries where a logical vector is true,
# and store the TRUE entries into a separate object


####### TASK 4: 1 point ################################

# Operations on the vectors
# 1. Create a character vector with 6 entries


# 2. Get the last element of the vector (explore length() function)



# 3. Create a numeric vector with values 2, 0, -3, 0, 5, 6 and sort the values from the LARGEST to the smallest.
# Hint: look at the sort() function


# Your output:

# 4. Combine your character vector with your numeric vector.



# 5. In R every element in the vector has a particular position or index, starting with [1]
# Check the indices for all items in your new vector with [] brackets



# 5. Delete the first six character items in your new vector, using their indices



# 6. Convert your vector to an integer vector



####### TASK 5: 1.5 points ################################

# Working with lists
# 1. Create a list containing two vectors: one vector is a variable with three names: "A1", "A2", "A3" 
# the other one is a vector with 10 randomly generated integers between 1 and 10 (hint: use sample() function)
# Print the results



# 2. Create one more list with two vectors: one is a range of numbers from 1 to 5,
# the second one is a LOGICAL vector with three variables, print the results



# 3. Combine two lists to create a larger list (hint: consider append() function)
# Print the results
